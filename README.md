## Budget Tracker

Objectives:
- WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit, THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
- WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection, THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
